# WGU-C950-Project
  This was a project that I did for WGU Data Structures and Algorithms II. The concept was to create a python program for a mail delivery company that would find the
shortest route that would deliver all packages and have the shortest mileage as possible. I decided to use a Hash Table for this program and a Greedy Algorithm. Although this
program is not the most efficient, it was still able to complete the route in 120.4 miles.

  Possible improvements for this program would be to have the distance data and the address data be CSV files as well. This would help with the expansion of this program
as you would just need to change the files instead of going into the code and changing the two variables associated with distances and addresses.
